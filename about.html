      <strong> Uttarakhand </strong>,once in the past known as <strong> Uttaranchal</strong>, is a state in the northern
      piece of India.
      It is frequently alluded to as the "Devabhumi" (truly "Land of the Gods") because of various Hindu
      temples and pilgrimage centres found all through the state. Uttarakhand is known for the regular
      habitat of the Himalayas, the Bhabar and the Terai. <br>
      On 9 November 2000, Uttarakhand turned into the 27th state of the Republic of India, being cut

      and Kumaon were conventional opponents, the closeness of various neighboring ethnic gatherings and the indivisible
