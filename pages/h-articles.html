                    In our deep consciousness we know we are complete. <br><br>

                    All religions and literatures of the world proclaim the same truth from time immemorial !
                    <br><br>

                    Even the contemporary Christ, Buddha and Judith - the realised souls - in their Quest went
                    through A Cosmic Voyage. <br><br>

                    The ancient Gurus and Gyani like Vashisht, Ashtavakra and Vyasa, to name a few, have through
                    their wise words and guidance have explained to benefit from a deep rooted quest and hinted the
                    way. <br><br>

                    As stated in Bhagwat Geeta, Krishna even shows the cosmic swaroop to Arjuna to have no doubt -
                    nishanshaya - and do the prescribed duties without expectation of the fruit of result - Na
                    faleshu kadachana. <br><br>

                    The need of reason is not inspired by the quest for truth but by the quest of meaning…..Hannah
                    Ardent. <br><br>

                    Even for the realised ones, quest of meaning never ends as he/she can’t be selfish only for
                    himself/herself! so, the quest and this cosmic voyage continues, even before, during and after
                    life. <br><br>

                    In our manifested world where we are digitising and pacing with ever faster technologies, an
                    artist makes us pause, in the infinite expanse of time and space. with her/his imagination,
                    dwells deeper, in the extremity of un manifested, where the senses are no more potent to
                    visualise and comprehend the wholesomeness. <br><br>

                    A life lived with purpose and meaning ever resonates with art. The art helps us to live in the
                    moment by reconnecting to our observer self which is essential for wholesomeness wherein the
                    observer, observed and observing becomes one. Get one which resonates with you. The subtle
                    influence of art is beyond words! <br><br>

                    No alt text provided for this image
                    The timeless imagination of the great art captures this richness of the wholesomeness. The art
                    stands in time and space with each stroke of imagination curated with the life force as though
                    imitating the real creation of life by God. <br><br>

                    The great art is what leaves to the imagination as much as what it expresses! Further, if it
                    could preen into the mood and imagination of the artist, Viola! <br><br>

                    No alt text provided for this image <br><br>
                    It’s soul merge and ecstatic! <br><br>

                    With richness of curiosity you would find reflection of the observer - the only and one truth -
                    Tat Twam Asi! Though are that! <br><br>

                    Welcome to this Cosmic voyage and experience the wholesomeness!

                    In the side lines of World Blockchain Summit 2019 on 20th June at Taj Santacruz, following
                    questions cropped up which I have tried to capture and share here. The complete panel discussion
                    recording to follow shortly. Till then.... <br><br>

                    Q1. How blockchain is disrupting various sectors? Is there a common thread running across?
                    <br><br>
                    Harish Pant: <br><br>

                    Digital technology is threading and meshing the world like never before and in the process we
                    see the emergence of the Mega Organisations wherein all other major, SMES and even start-ups are
                    becoming a part of the bigger ecosystem in a platform driven economy. <br><br>

                    Welcome to the “Mega- O”, wherein the leaders would shed their limited industry / country /
                    product / Service boundaries perspective, depending on their respective business context. This
                    is an orbital shift from magnanimous collaborate and compete model, and tending towards more of
                    a philanthropic large heartedness, wherein few billion dollars are spent not because it fits in
                    the present ROI but for building the future and common good for the Business Nextgen. <br><br>

                    Blockchain is not a quantum argument – how many and who all? If we take internet usage, even
                    that would take a few more decades for the each one of the seven billion population to get
                    covered with reliable and quality services. A few blockchain usage have potential to impact a
                    common life immensely. E.g. few government records of citizen does away with a lot of
                    duplicative documents and procedures and the resultant frustration. <br><br>

                    Q2. If the Blockchain is immensely transformative at a national and global level as you state,
                    what are the impediments for a speedy implementation? Why not go all out? <br><br>

                    Harish Pant: <br><br>

                    Transformation takes time as there are early adaptors, followed by the fence seater crossing and
                    then mass implementation. Even then a few may hold on to the old for long either by choice or by
                    various economic and social constraints. <br><br>

                    Digital transformation has a multidimensions impact and as the new technology like AI, Machine
                    learnings, VR, AR with ever better hardware and software coming in with added pace of quantum
                    computing, we are enamoured with the possibilities. There may be a latent pause but once it gets
                    set in, the pace of change would be astonishing. <br><br>

                    For many Indian and global companies, ERP effectiveness, Business Processes digitisation, system
                    led excellence and now Industry 4.0 itself is a noodle affair and with the newer set of
                    disruptors, it’s difficult for a many individuals and organisations to suddenly develop a new
                    perspective where the present models, decision making and business strategies have become
                    outdated. <br><br>

                    It’s difficult to fathom that many a job, event and efforts do not add value. Now these
                    technologies have a potential to eliminate the entire third party itself and with it all non
                    value added activities in the entirety. Now with the technology, we can accomplish our
                    activities seamlessly in a secured environment with the least possible costs. <br><br>

                    A new culture code is to be written which will entail deciphering digital ethics. <br><br>

                    Q3. Blockchain has a huge impact on the supply-chain segment. Within the auto and auto
                    components, what are the key bottlenecks the block-chain could resolve? <br><br>

                    Harish Pant: <br><br>

                    As per the Digital Transformation Group, constituted by SIAM and ACMA supported by IBM,
                    Blockchain can focus on these areas as the first priority, adding my perspective too. <br><br>

                    · Traceability of parts <br>

                    · Procure to Pay – autoDx Blockchain <br>

                    · Warranty <br>

                    · Dispute management <br>

                    · O2C - Ecosystem partners connect – OEM, Distributor, dealer and online partner <br><br>

                    OEM major are called upon to take a lead role and show the way through establishing a digital
                    platform which is blockchain enabled. <br><br>

                    @ACMA India <br><br>

                    Q4. Is Indian infrastructure well equipped to adopt blockchain? Is India block-chain ready?
                    Where do you feel is the shortfall? <br><br>

                    Harish Pant: <br><br>

                    Add on required in infrastructure for most of the blockchain is incremental hence easy to
                    implement. Scaling up is attaianble with the Cloud computing and Storage available through a
                    third part as service. <br><br>

                    It’s just a matter of assigning priority and leading players acting on it with alacrity and
                    willingness for this industry wide transformative drive to help realise the full impact of the
                    new technology. India can show the way as the proven solutions for India would be also be a
                    right solutions for the world too. Elimination of corruption from the country is the icing in
                    the cake. <br><br>

                    Q5. When are we likely to move ahead from user cases and experience full-fledged adoption?
                    <br><br>

                    Harish Pant: <br><br>

                    Government taking the initial lead followed by industry wide implementation by the top players
                    will help in lower tier based players to hook in. Bold moves by the leaders will pave the way!
                    <br><br>

                    Few blockchain will be sufficient for an Industry/country to serve a many enterprises and a
                    billion population! <br><br>

                    Q6. Any message to young entrepreneurs and leaders? <br><br>

                    Harish Pant: <br><br>

                    Don’t waste time in arguing when, where and how much. In a digital transformative world, few
                    changes shake up the world. A centuries transformative impact now happens in a few years or a
                    few phenomena which have never ever been experienced by the humanity. Because you cannot make a
                    sense of it, does not mean other would not be able to and a few who would, they will lead the
                    next wave of growth. <br><br>

                    Keep learning deeply to make a sense of digital transformation and ask why not now!

                    country uncompetitive. Further, global warming and the associated social implications are far
                    reaching as the negative externalities weigh high on the already high tax paying society. In the
                    ocean of overcapacity and warehouses brimming full, one finds people toiling in under
                    employment. <br><br>
                    India’s intent to achieve 5 trillion GDP needs this addressed squarely and the earlier the
                    better. Before we chase trillions of fresh funds for growth, we need to plug in the shear
                    resource waste. It’s a low-lying fruit as compared to developing long term technology edge where
                    a many country are decades ahead. <br><br>

                    We certainly need national grids of Rail, road, air and water and the related infrastructures,
                    in addition to the water grid, digital grid and energy grid, but all these will come to naught
                    if the freight carriers do not improve upon to be the best in the world, to give us competitive
                    advantage. As per one of the recent estimates, India’s logistics cost is about 14% as compared
                    to the world best at less than 9%. <br><br>

                    Let’s do something specific in this domain by taking a country wide initiative. Why not turn a
                    problem as an opportunity to leap! <br><br>

                    Most of the entrepreneurial striving remains dwarfed at MSME Scale, not because of capabilities
                    and capacities, but due to structural issues and plethora of hindrances on the way from start-up
                    onwards. Logistics happens to be one of them. Someone pays for the high idle time of these
                    trucks, manual loadings and warehousing and old and overloaded trucks chugging along to somehow
                    reach the destination. The average speed of freight is at a snail pace of no more than 30kmph.
                    <br><br>

                    While government has come out with an aspirational e-Vehicle policy and budget support for
                    Passenger Vehicle, there is nothing in this budget which peps up the languishing Commercial
                    vehicle market. <br><br>

                    Let’s up the game…few thoughts <br><br>

                    1. Create a Bharat Freight Grid (BFG) Corporation which is an integrated, connected and agile
                    freight movement with multiple objectives. This is created through SPV and with PPP Model. A
                    special infra bond to be created to build the initial corpus of say 50,000 crores. FPI is
                    allowed to invest too. Commercial vehicle manufacturer can also buy the bonds in bulk and
                    available to general public too. This SPV is be managed by a private third party. <br><br>

                    2. In the first phase, all the old trucks more than 10years old to be scraped and replaced by
                    Bharat VI trucks. A massive incentive to be given through a combined contribution by Government
                    through GST forgone (from the present 28%) and matched by equal amount/percentage by the
                    manufacturers. Say, 10% each thus reducing truck price by 20% or more. <br><br>

                    3. The declared price and model will be available to the purchaser of new trucks in proportion
                    to the bond bought by the Truck Manufacturer with an upper cap. An algorithm can be created to
                    arrive at a fair play among truck manufacturers while giving free choice to the buyers. <br><br>

                    4. The trucks will have a distinct look with radio tag, GPS and connectivity with no toll tax
                    and road tax so that they move with great pace and ease throughout the country. These trucks can
                    be further connected through a portal to Railways and Air freight, at one end with micro
                    mobility network and at the other for a seamless long distance freight movement across the
                    country. These will have a national permit. The implementation of Blockchain, AI and other
                    technologies can help track each to provide seamless movement without any stoppage. <br><br>

                    5. Any fraudulent practice and player would be dealt with strict law enforcement. <br><br>

                    6. This platform will be akin to UPI payment gateway and does not replace the exiting logistics
                    players but rather show cases on the future of freight mobility. It will kick start a new
                    national freight movement which is marred with various constraints hence the existing players do
                    not come forward to change the game and take it as given - why boil ocean for your cup of tea/!
                    <br><br>

                    7. A third party can be further engaged to scrap and use the material out of scraped trucks and
                    the money realised through scrap can be also offered as further discount. <br><br>

                    8. The MSME, depending upon the size of their enterprise, can get a different discount and
                    preferences based on an algorithm. Benefit where it is needed most. <br><br>

                    Will the four ministers from Finance, Transport, Commerce and Heavy Industry join hands and
                    invite the Indian stalwarts of Tata, Mahindra, Ashok Leyland and MNC CEO's Daimler, Volvo to
                    show case to the world, how Economical, Environmental and Social impact be created in the
                    challenging times like these? <br><br>

                    Incrementalism is not the lexicon of the great leaders! <br><br>
